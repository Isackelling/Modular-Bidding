## System Overview

The Sherman Bidding System is a web application for managing manufactured home installation quotes, contracts, and project cost tracking for Sherman Pole Buildings (Sherman Lumber Inc., Mora MN).

It handles the full lifecycle: customer intake → quote → accepted → contract → cost tracking (Scrubb) → completion.

## Glossary

Canonical definitions for every domain term used in this spec. All sections must use these terms exactly. If a term is not in this glossary, it should not appear in the codebase.

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Quote** | A priced estimate for a modular home installation job. Lives in the `quotes` array. |
| **Contract** | An accepted quote copied into the `contracts` array. Tracks actual costs during construction. |
| **Change Order (CO)** | A revision to an existing contract that adds, removes, or adjusts line items. Versioned as CO #1a, #1b, #2a, etc. |
| **Scrubb** | The cost-tracking interface where Admin and Crew record actual costs against contract estimates during construction. Named after the internal process, not an acronym. |
| **NHL Contract** | A grouped line item in Scrubb combining three costs: materials total (matT) + installation_of_home + painting. Always tracked as one unit. "NHL" is a legacy internal label. |
| **Allowance Item** | One of 6 services whose costs are estimated at quote time but finalized during construction: permits, gravel_driveway, sand_pad, sewer, well, crane. Variances flow into the contingency fund. |
| **Contingency Fund** | A budget reserve (default 2% of total) that absorbs allowance overages and receives allowance savings. Customers can refill it via contingency payments. |
| **Contingency Payment** | A customer payment that refills the contingency fund. Stored in `scrubbPayments` with `isContingencyPayment = true`. These are additions to the fund, not draws. |
| **matT** | Materials total — the sum of all material costs (pier, siding, trim, etc.). |
| **svcT** | Services total — the sum of all selected service costs + utility services + custom services. |
| **projCmd** | Project Command — the combined cost of PS + PM + PC (supervision, management, coordination). |
| **PS** | Project Supervisor — on-site supervisor cost, scales with number of services and miles. |
| **PM** | Project Manager — management cost, scales with miles. |
| **PC** | Project Coordinator — coordination cost, derived from PM. |
| **driveTime** | Despite the name, this is a **distance in miles** (not a time). Represents one-way distance from Sherman to the job site. Minimum enforced: 15 miles. |
| **driveCost** | The dollar cost of one drive trip: `miles × DRIVE_RATE_SERVICE ($20/mi)`. |
| **Variance** | `contractPrice - actualCost`. Positive = under budget (savings). Negative = over budget (overage). |
| **calcTotals()** | The pricing engine function that computes all derived costs from a quote's fields. Located in `src/utils/calculations.js`. |
| **emptyQuote()** | The factory function that defines all canonical field names with default values. Located in `src/App.jsx`. This is the schema source of truth. |
| **Customer Portal** | A read-only view for customers accessed via password `mybid` + firstName + lastName. Shows quotes, budget tracker, and published notes. |
| **Published Notes** | Notes that have been explicitly published (moved from draft to the published array). Only published notes appear in documents and the customer portal. Draft notes are private. |

**Deprecated terms — do not use:**

| Deprecated | Replacement | Reason |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| ~~sewerSystem~~ | `sewerType` | Field was never a "system"; it selects a sewer bed size |
| ~~wellSystem~~ | `wellDepth` | Field stores depth in feet, not a system type |
| ~~patio~~ | `patioSize` | Field is a size selector ('none', '6', '8', '10'), not a boolean |
| ~~patioWidth / patioLength~~ | `patioSize` | Patio is selected by pre-set size, not custom dimensions |
| ~~landscaping~~ | `hasLandscaping` | Boolean toggle, requires the `has` prefix |
| ~~deckProject~~ | `hasDeck` | Boolean toggle, requires the `has` prefix |
| ~~hasGarage~~ | (none) | Garages are not part of this system |
| ~~manufactured~~ | **modular** | Company rebranding — use "modular home" everywhere in UI and documents |

---

## Architecture

- **Framework:** React 18 + Vite, single-page application
- **Persistence:** localStorage via `window.storage`
- **No backend** — all data lives in the browser
- **Dev server:** `localhost:3001`
- **Build output:** `dist/`
- **Auth:** Staff password (`SHERMAN` / `BIDDING`), then username selection. Customer portal: `mybid` + firstName + lastName

---

## Non-Goals / Out of Scope

This spec does NOT cover and the system does NOT implement:

- **No backend or database.** All data is localStorage only. No server, no API, no cloud sync.
- **No multi-user concurrency.** One browser = one user at a time. No conflict resolution, locking, or merge logic.
- **No email, SMS, or push notifications.** All communication happens outside the app.
- **No PDF generation.** Documents are HTML opened in new browser windows for printing via the browser's native print dialog.
- **No mobile-specific layouts.** The app is designed for desktop use. It may render on mobile but responsive behavior is not specified.
- **No undo/redo system.** Changes are saved immediately. There is no history stack or revert capability beyond the scrubbHistory log.
- **No audit logging beyond scrubbHistory.** Quote edits, user actions, and login events are not logged.
- **No data import/export.** No CSV, Excel, or bulk import. No data migration tooling.
- **No internationalization.** English only, USD only, Minnesota-centric.
- **No automated testing infrastructure.** Tests are manual via the sync check and system test playbooks.
- **No garage, barn, or non-home structures.** The system handles modular home installation only.

---

## User Roles

| Role | Can Do |
|------|--------|
| **Admin** | Everything. Can switch to Sales or Crew view for testing. |
| **Sales** | Create/edit customers and quotes, generate documents, manage files |
| **Crew** | Read-only jobs view, access Scrubb tab, upload crew files |
| **Customer** | Read-only portal — view own quotes, active job budget tracker, published notes |

**Scrubb tab** is accessible to Admin and Crew only. Sales cannot access it.

## Calculation Pipeline

### Total Cost Formula

```
matT     = sum of all material costs
svcT     = sum of all selected service costs + utility services + custom services
homePrice = homeBasePrice × 1.2   (HOME_MARKUP = 1.2)
projCmd  = Project Command total (PS + PM + PC)

sub      = matT + svcT + homePrice + projCmd
oh       = sub × 0.05              (overhead, always 5%)
mu       = (sub + oh) × markupRate (default 10%, configurable per quote)
total    = sub + oh + mu

contingency = total × contingencyRate  (default 2%, configurable per quote)
totalWithContingency = total + contingency
```

**Closing Costs** (optional service, `closing_costs`):
- Self-referential: `closingCost = total × (0.07 / 0.93)`
- Added to svcT, then sub/oh/mu/total are recalculated

### Project Command (PS + PM + PC)

```
miles    = max(driveTime, 15)
numSvc   = count of selected services + utilities + custom services

PS (Project Supervisor) = (numSvc × $150) + (miles × $15 × numSvc)
PM (Project Manager)    = (miles × $15) + $4,000
PC (Project Coordinator) = (PM / 2) + (miles × $15)
```

### Drive Rates

| Usage | Rate |
|-------|------|
| Installation of Home | $20/mi (INSTALLATION_COSTS.DRIVE_RATE_PER_MILE) |
| Services (general) | $20/mi (DRIVE_RATE_SERVICE) |
| Project Command | $15/mi (DRIVE_RATE_PC) |
| Install transport | $22/mi (DRIVE_RATE_INSTALL) |
| **Minimum miles** | **15** (enforced by `enforceMiles()`) |

### Installation of Home Cost Breakdown

```
installation       = (miles × $20 × 2) + ($800 single / $1,600 double)
axles              = $275 single / $550 double
deliveryInspection = (miles × $20) + $600
wrapUp             = (miles × $20) + $600
foundationAdj      = +$4,000 if foundationType = 'basement' or 'crawlspace'

total = installation + axles + deliveryInspection + wrapUp + foundationAdj
```

### Foundation Adjustments (service price add-ons)

> **Cross-cutting concern:** These adjustments modify service prices defined elsewhere. When implementing any service's price calculation, check if foundationType triggers an add-on here.

When `foundationType = 'basement'`:
- `sand_pad` +$5,000
- `plumbing` +$2,000
- `electric_connection` +$3,000
- Auto-adds: `basement_stairs` ($2,000+drive), `water_heater` ($1,500+drive), `updraft_furnace` ($6,000+drive)

When `foundationType = 'crawlspace'`:
- `sand_pad` +$5,000

### Utility Service Pricing

**Sewer** (selected via `sewerType`):
- `1_bed` = $14,200 + (driveCost × 2)
- `2_bed` = $16,700 + (driveCost × 2)
- `3_bed` = $17,200 + (driveCost × 2)

**Well** (`wellDepth` > 0):
- `$120 × wellDepth ft` + driveCost

**Patio** (selected via `patioSize`):
- `6` = $8,300
- `8` = $10,300
- `10` = $13,800

### Special Service Calculations

**Concrete Skirting:**
```
patioExtra = patioSize > 0 ? patioSize × 2 : 0
cost = ((24 × (perimeter + patioExtra)) + ((miles + 200) × 3)) × 1.1
```

**LP SmartSide Siding:**
```
length ≤ 52' → $6,550 × 1.05
length 53–64' → $6,950 × 1.05
length ≥ 65' → $7,850 × 1.05
```

**Landscaping** (`hasLandscaping = true`):
```
cost = landscapingMaterialCost + $1,200 labor + (driveCost × landscapingDays)
```

**Deck** (`hasDeck = true`):
```
cost = deckMaterialCost + $1,200 labor + (driveCost × deckDays)
```

**Foundation - Slab:**
```
cost = (houseWidth × houseLength × $8) + driveCost
```

**Foundation - Basement/Crawlspace:**
- Basement default: $30,000 + driveCost
- Crawlspace default: $22,000 + driveCost

### Material Quantities

| Material | Quantity Formula |
|----------|-----------------|
| Great Stuff | Fixed: 2 |
| Floor Coverings | `ceil(((width × 12) / 39) × length / 100)` |
| 16x4 Cookies | `walkDoors × 6` |
| Tyvek | Fixed: 1 |
| Anchor System | Fixed: 2 |
| 20" Steel Pier | `pierCount + (walkDoors × 2)` — when iBeam ≥ 11 |
| 22" Steel Pier | `pierCount + (walkDoors × 2)` — when iBeam < 11 |
| 32" Steel Pier | `ceil(length / 12)` — marriage line (double-wide only) |
| Tie Down Straps | Fixed: 4 — single-wide only |
| Coil Nails | Fixed: 1 |
| Asphalt Silicon | Fixed: 2 |
| Stairs (4-step) | `walkDoors` count |
| Heat Tape | Fixed: 1 |
| Fiberglass Wrap | Fixed: 1 |
| Aluminum Foil Tape | Fixed: 1 |

### Pier Count

```
Single-wide: pierCount = ceil(2 × ceil(length/6 + 1) × 1  + 2 × walkDoors)
Double-wide: pierCount = ceil(2 × ceil(length/6 + 1) × 2.5)
```

### I-Beam Height

```
calcIBeam(length):
  length < 56ft  → 10"
  length ≥ 56ft  → 12"

Pier size selection:
  iBeamHeight ≥ 11  → 20" steel pier
  iBeamHeight < 11  → 22" steel pier
```

## Worked Examples

These examples show complete calculations for representative scenarios. A correct implementation must reproduce these numbers exactly.

### Example A: 60ft Double-Wide, Slab Foundation, 30 miles

**Inputs:**
```
houseWidth: 28, houseLength: 60, singleDouble: 'double'
foundationType: 'slab', walkDoors: 2, driveTime: 30
sewerType: '2_bed', wellDepth: '120', patioSize: '8'
homeBasePrice: 95000, markupRate: '10', contingencyRate: '2'
All 12 default services selected. No custom services.
hasLandscaping: false, hasDeck: false
```

**Pier Calculation:**
```
iBeamHeight = 12" (length 60 ≥ 56)
pier type = 20" steel (iBeam 12 ≥ 11)
pierCount = ceil(2 × ceil(60/6 + 1) × 2.5)
          = ceil(2 × ceil(11) × 2.5)
          = ceil(2 × 11 × 2.5)
          = ceil(55) = 55
20" pier quantity = 55 + (2 × 2) = 59
32" pier quantity = ceil(60 / 12) = 5  (marriage line, double-wide)
```

**Drive Costs:**
```
miles = max(30, 15) = 30
driveCost (service) = 30 × $20 = $600
```

**Installation of Home:**
```
installation       = (30 × $20 × 2) + $1,600 = $2,800
axles              = $550 (double)
deliveryInspection = (30 × $20) + $600 = $1,200
wrapUp             = (30 × $20) + $600 = $1,200
foundationAdj      = $0 (slab, not basement/crawlspace)
total              = $2,800 + $550 + $1,200 + $1,200 = $5,750
```

**Foundation Slab:**
```
cost = (28 × 60 × $8) + $600 = $13,440 + $600 = $14,040
```

**Sewer (2_bed):**
```
cost = $16,700 + ($600 × 2) = $17,900
```

**Well:**
```
cost = $120 × 120 + $600 = $14,400 + $600 = $15,000
```

**Patio (8ft):**
```
cost = $10,300
```

**Closing Costs (self-referential formula explanation):**
```
Why 0.07 / 0.93: Closing costs are 7% of the FINAL total, but they are
themselves part of that total. To avoid circular math:
  closingCost = totalBeforeClosing × (0.07 / 0.93)
This ensures that when closingCost is added to the total, closing costs
are exactly 7% of the new total.

Example: if totalBeforeClosing = $100,000
  closingCost = $100,000 × (0.07 / 0.93) = $7,526.88
  newTotal = $107,526.88
  verify: $7,526.88 / $107,526.88 = 7.00% ✓
```

### Example B: 48ft Single-Wide, Basement, 15 miles (minimum)

**Inputs:**
```
houseWidth: 16, houseLength: 48, singleDouble: 'single'
foundationType: 'basement', walkDoors: 2, driveTime: 10
sewerType: 'none', wellDepth: '0', patioSize: 'none'
```

**Key differences from Example A:**
```
miles = max(10, 15) = 15  (minimum enforced)
iBeamHeight = 10" (length 48 < 56)
pier type = 22" steel (iBeam 10 < 11)
pierCount = ceil(2 × ceil(48/6 + 1) × 1 + 2 × 2)
          = ceil(2 × ceil(9) × 1 + 4)
          = ceil(2 × 9 + 4)
          = ceil(22) = 22
No 32" marriage line piers (single-wide)
Tie down straps: 4 (single-wide only)

Basement triggers:
  - installation foundationAdj = +$4,000
  - sand_pad price += $5,000
  - plumbing price += $2,000
  - electric_connection price += $3,000
  - Auto-adds: basement_stairs, water_heater, updraft_furnace

wellDepth = '0' → well is NOT selected (no cost)
sewerType = 'none' → sewer is NOT selected (no cost)
patioSize = 'none' → patio is NOT selected (no cost)
```

### Example C: Contingency Fund Tracking

**Scenario:** Contract with $200,000 total, 2% contingency, two allowance items tracked.

```
startingContingency = $200,000 × 0.02 = $4,000

Permits: contractPrice = $3,000, actualCost = $2,500
  variance = $3,000 - $2,500 = +$500 (savings → added to fund)

Gravel driveway: contractPrice = $5,000, actualCost = $6,200
  variance = $5,000 - $6,200 = -$1,200 (overage → drawn from fund)

One change order drew $800 from contingency:
  totalCODraws = $800

Customer made one contingency payment of $1,000:
  contingencyPayments = $1,000

currentBalance = $4,000 - $800 + $500 - $1,200 + $1,000 = $3,500
```

---

## Default Services (Pre-Selected on New Quote)

```
installation_of_home, drywall, painting, carpet, dumpster,
siding_install, interior_trim_out, permits, electric_connection,
concrete_skirting, plumbing, gas_propane
```
Total: 12 services pre-selected.

---

## Allowance Items

> **Depends on:** Calculation Pipeline (service pricing), Contingency Fund (variance flows into fund)
> **Required state:** Quote must be a contract with scrubbCosts populated

These 6 items have estimated costs at quote time, finalized during construction.
They are tracked in the Scrubb tab and affect the contingency fund balance.

```javascript
ALLOWANCE_ITEMS = ['permits', 'gravel_driveway', 'sand_pad', 'sewer', 'well', 'crane']
```

---

## Contingency Fund

> **Depends on:** Allowance Items (variance values), Change Orders (CO draws), scrubbPayments (contingency payments)
> **Required state:** Quote must be a contract. Contingency only has meaning during active construction tracking.

**Three locations must produce identical results:**
1. `src/App.jsx` (inline Scrubb tab) — Contingency Fund Tracker
2. `src/utils/documents/generateAllowanceProgressDocument.js`
3. `src/components/Auth/CustomerPortal.jsx` → `renderBudgetTracker`

Note: `src/components/Quotes/ScrubbTab.jsx` is dead code (not imported). The Scrubb tab is inline in App.jsx.

**Formula:**
```
startingContingency = total × contingencyRate  (default 2%)
                      (or reconstructed from CO history: coHistory[0].contingencyUsed + contingencyBalance)

totalCODraws        = sum of contingencyUsed from changeOrderHistory

allowanceSavings    = sum of variance > 0 for ALLOWANCE_ITEMS
allowanceOverages   = sum of abs(variance) where variance < 0 for ALLOWANCE_ITEMS

contingencyPayments = scrubbPayments.filter(p => p.isContingencyPayment)
                                    .reduce(sum of p.amount)
                      NOTE: These are customer REFILLS to the fund (added back)

currentBalance = startingContingency - totalCODraws + allowanceSavings - allowanceOverages + contingencyPayments
```

**Variance sign convention:**
```
variance = contractPrice - actualCost
Positive = under budget → savings → added to contingency fund
Negative = over budget  → overage → drawn from contingency fund
```

---

## NHL Contract (Scrubb Grouping)

In the Scrubb cost-tracking interface, these three items are always grouped into one "NHL Contract" line:

```
NHL Contract = matT (materials total) + installation_of_home + painting
```

---

## Status Workflows

### Quote Status
```
Draft → Sent → Accepted
              ↓
           Declined
```
Accepted quote is copied into the contracts array. Original remains in quotes.

### Contract Status
```
Accepted → Under Contract → Completed
         ↘                ↗
           Cancelled (any point)
```

### Change Order Numbering
```
Original quote / contract → CO #1a → (revise) → CO #1b → (new CO) → CO #2a
```

---

## Document Generators

> **Depends on:** calcTotals() must have run first — generators consume computed totals, not raw fields. All generators also depend on the Quote Object Schema (field names) and Customer Object Schema (customer data joined at generation time).

All 8 generators are in `src/utils/documentGeneration.js`.

## Cross-Verification Requirements

Values that must match across multiple locations. A sync check must verify all of these.

### Contingency Balance (3 locations)
The contingency fund `currentBalance` must produce identical results in:
1. `src/App.jsx` — inline Scrubb tab, Contingency Fund Tracker section
2. `src/utils/documents/generateAllowanceProgressDocument.js` — printed allowance report
3. `src/components/Auth/CustomerPortal.jsx` → `renderBudgetTracker` — customer-facing view

All three must use the same formula: `startingContingency - totalCODraws + allowanceSavings - allowanceOverages + contingencyPayments`

### Total Cost (4 locations)
The `total` and `totalWithContingency` values must match across:
1. `calcTotals()` — the computation source
2. `generateCustomerQuote` — customer-facing document
3. `generateQuoteHtml` — internal admin document
4. `generateJobSummaryReport` — post-completion report

### Variance Sign Convention (all Scrubb-related code)
`variance = contractPrice - actualCost` — positive is savings, negative is overage. Must be consistent in:
1. Scrubb tab inline in App.jsx
2. `generateAllowanceProgressDocument`
3. `CustomerPortal.jsx` budget tracker

### Drive Rate Usage (4 distinct rates)
Each rate is used in specific contexts only. Using the wrong rate is a silent pricing bug:
| Rate | Constant | Used for |
|------|----------|----------|
| $20/mi | `DRIVE_RATE_SERVICE` | General service drive costs |
| $20/mi | `INSTALLATION_COSTS.DRIVE_RATE_PER_MILE` | Installation of home calculation |
| $15/mi | `DRIVE_RATE_PC` | Project Command (PS, PM, PC) |
| $22/mi | `DRIVE_RATE_INSTALL` | Install transport |

### NHL Contract Grouping
Wherever NHL Contract appears (Scrubb tab, allowance document), it must equal exactly: `matT + installation_of_home + painting`. No other items included, none of these three excluded.

### Foundation Adjustment Propagation
When `foundationType` changes, these must all update in the same `calcTotals()` pass:
- `installation_of_home` foundationAdj (+$4,000 for basement/crawlspace)
- `sand_pad` price (+$5,000 for basement, +$5,000 for crawlspace)
- `plumbing` price (+$2,000 for basement only)
- `electric_connection` price (+$3,000 for basement only)
- Auto-added services (basement only): `basement_stairs`, `water_heater`, `updraft_furnace`

## File Folder Structure

Each quote has 5 folders in `quote.folders`:

| Key | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `clayton_docs` | Factory docs, floor plans, spec sheets |
| `crew_files` | Crew work orders, installation docs, customer info |
| `estimates` | Customer quotes, scope of work, allowance updates |
| `permits` | Permit documentation, inspection reports |
| `change_orders` | Change order documents |

File object: `{ id, name, type, url, notes, addedBy, addedAt }`

## Boundary Conditions & Edge Cases

How the system handles zero, empty, and edge-case inputs. A correct implementation must handle all of these without crashing or producing NaN.

| Field | Edge Value | Expected Behavior |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| `driveTime` | `'0'`, `'5'`, empty | Enforce minimum 15 miles via `enforceMiles()`. Never calculate with < 15. |
| `wellDepth` | `'0'` or empty | Well is not selected. Cost = $0. Do not add well to services. |
| `sewerType` | `'none'` | Sewer is not selected. Cost = $0. Do not add sewer to services. |
| `patioSize` | `'none'` | Patio is not selected. Cost = $0. `patioExtra` in concrete skirting = 0. |
| `houseLength` | `'0'` or empty | Quote is incomplete. Pier count formula should not produce NaN — treat as 0. |
| `houseWidth` | `'0'` or empty | Quote is incomplete. Slab cost should be $0, not NaN. |
| `walkDoors` | `0` or undefined | Cookie count = 0, stair count = 0, pier adjustment = 0. |
| `homeBasePrice` | `'0'` or empty | homePrice = $0. Total still calculated from services + materials. |
| `selectedServices` | All deselected | svcT = $0. Project Command numSvc = 0, so PS = $0 + drive component. |
| `customServices` | Empty array `[]` | No custom services. Do not add to svcT. |
| `scrubbCosts` | Empty object `{}` | All actual costs = $0. Variances = full contract price (savings). |
| `scrubbPayments` | Missing or `undefined` | Treat as empty array. contingencyPayments = $0. |
| `changeOrderHistory` | Missing or empty | totalCODraws = $0. startingContingency = `total × contingencyRate`. |
| `contingencyRate` | Missing or empty | Default to `'2'` (2%). |
| `markupRate` | Missing or empty | Default to `'10'` (10%). |
| `landscapingMaterialCost` | `'0'` or empty when `hasLandscaping` = true | Cost = $0 material + $1,200 labor + drive. Labor and drive still apply. |
| `deckMaterialCost` | `'0'` or empty when `hasDeck` = true | Same as landscaping — labor and drive still apply. |
| `iBeamHeight` | Missing | Calculate from `houseLength` via `calcIBeam()`. Never leave undefined. |
| `foundationType` | `'none'` | No foundation service. No adjustments. No foundation cost. |

**String-to-number parsing:** All user-entered cost/quantity fields are stored as strings. Calculations must `parseFloat()` and handle NaN (treat as 0).
